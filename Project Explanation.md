  - Enabled **Continuous Integration (CI)** to automate the merging and validation of code from different developers.

- **Multi-Stage Pipelines:**
  - Built and configured **multi-stage pipelines** for environment-specific deployments (development, staging, and production).

- **Automated Testing Integration:**
  - Integrated automated testing into the pipelines to ensure high-quality code releases and minimize downtime during deployments.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
  - Implemented **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using **Terraform templates** to manage infrastructure efficiently, allowing version control and environment reproducibility.

- **Scaling and Monitoring:**
  - Upskilled on scaling and monitoring applications using **Azure Monitor**, **Application Insights**, and **Log Analytics** to track performance, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot real-time issues.

- **Individual Contributor and Team Player:**
  - Worked as both an individual contributor and team player, handling different user stories directly while collaborating with the team on various tasks.

# Hosting POS Sales System Using React and Django on Azure DevOps

This guide outlines the steps for hosting a Point of Sale (POS) system built with a React frontend and Django backend using Azure DevOps.

---

## 1. Setting Up Azure Resources

### Azure Web App for Django Backend:
- Log in to the Azure portal and create an **Azure Web App** for the Django backend.
- Choose the appropriate **Runtime Stack** (e.g., Python 3.x).
- Configure the **App Service Plan** based on the performance and scaling needs.
- Create a **PostgreSQL Database** (if applicable) in Azure, and connect it with your Django app.

### Azure Web App for React Frontend:
- Create another **Azure Web App** service for the React frontend.
- Choose the **Runtime Stack** as Node.js (if applicable) for React hosting.
- Configure the **App Service Plan** and ensure both frontend and backend apps use the same region for performance.

---

## 2. Setting Up Azure DevOps Repositories

- Log in to **Azure DevOps** and create a new project for your POS system.
- Create separate **Git repositories** for the React frontend and Django backend in Azure Repos, or use **GitHub** integration with Azure DevOps.
- Push your code for both the React and Django projects to their respective repositories.

## 3. Building CI/CD Pipelines in Azure DevOps

### CI/CD Pipeline for Django Backend:
1. In Azure DevOps, go to **Pipelines** and create a new pipeline for the Django backend.
2. Choose your repository and configure the pipeline using the YAML file or the classic editor.
3. Define the pipeline steps:
   - Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
   - Run Django unit tests.
   - Build the Django application.
   - Deploy the application to the Azure Web App.
   - Connect to the PostgreSQL database.
4. Set up the deployment environment using the following example YAML code:

   ```yaml
   pool:
     vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

   steps:
   - task: UsePythonVersion@0
     inputs:
       versionSpec: '3.x'
   - script: |
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       python manage.py migrate
       python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   - task: AzureWebApp@1
     inputs:
       azureSubscription: 'Your Azure Subscription'
       appName: 'Your Django Web App'
       package: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/<path to package>


   CI/CD Pipeline for React Frontend:
In Azure DevOps, create a new pipeline for the React frontend.

Configure the pipeline with the following steps:

Install Node.js and React dependencies.
Run React unit tests.
Build the React application.
Deploy the static files to the Azure Web App service.
Example YAML code for the React frontend pipeline:


pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '14.x'
- script: |
    npm install
    npm run build
- task: AzureRmWebAppDeployment@4
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: 'Your Azure Subscription'
    WebAppName: 'Your React Web App'
    packageForLinux: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/build'

5. Running and Monitoring the Application
After deploying, use Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and Log Analytics to track the performance of both frontend and backend services.
Set up alerts for downtime, errors, or performance degradation.
Scale the apps by adjusting the App Service Plan settings based on traffic.
