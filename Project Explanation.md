In Azure Web App service for Django, configure environment variables for database connection, secret keys, and other configuration settings.
Ensure that the React frontend has the correct API endpoint for the Django backend.
5. Running and Monitoring the Application
After deploying, use Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and Log Analytics to track the performance of both frontend and backend services.
Set up alerts for downtime, errors, or performance degradation.
Scale the apps by adjusting the App Service Plan settings based on traffic.

# How to Push Latest Changes from Developer Repositories to Main Branch and Trigger a Build in Azure DevOps

---

## 1. Ensure Each Developer Branch is Up-to-Date

Before merging, ensure that each developer's branch has the latest changes from the main branch.

### Steps for Developers:
1. **Pull Latest Changes from Main Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout <developer-branch>
   git pull origin main
Resolve Merge Conflicts (if any) in the local branch.
Push the Updated Developer Branch to Remote:
bash
Copy code
git push origin <developer-branch>
2. Merge Developer Branches to Main
After all developer branches are up-to-date, merge them into the main branch.

Using Azure DevOps Pull Requests:
In Azure DevOps, navigate to Repos > Pull Requests.
Create a new pull request:
Select the developer branch as the source and main branch as the target.
Add reviewers and required comments.
Review and approve the pull request to merge the changes into the main branch.
Resolve any merge conflicts (if any) within the Azure DevOps UI or locally and update the pull request.
Alternatively, merge manually via Git:

Manual Merge Process:
Checkout Main Branch Locally:
bash
Copy code
git checkout main
Merge Developer Branch into Main:
bash
Copy code
git merge <developer-branch>
Push the Updated Main Branch:
bash
Copy code
git push origin main
3. Set Up CI Pipeline for Automated Build
Ensure you have an Azure DevOps pipeline configured to trigger automatically when changes are pushed to the main branch.

Create/Modify CI Pipeline:
Navigate to Azure DevOps > Pipelines.
Set up a new pipeline or modify an existing pipeline to run on the main branch:
Go to the Triggers section.
Enable the option for Continuous Integration.
Select the main branch as the trigger.
Example YAML code to trigger a build when changes are pushed to main:

yaml
Copy code
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '14.x'
- script: |
    npm install
    npm run build
- task: CopyFiles@2
  inputs:
    SourceFolder: 'build'
    Contents: '**'
    TargetFolder: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    pathToPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    artifactName: 'drop'
4. Trigger the Build After Merging
Once the pull requests are merged into the main branch, Azure DevOps will automatically trigger the CI pipeline based on the above configuration.

To Manually Trigger the Build:
Go to Pipelines in Azure DevOps.
Select the pipeline for your project.
Click Run Pipeline and select the main branch to build the latest version.
5. Monitor Build and Deployment
Monitor the build status in Azure DevOps > Pipelines > Runs.
Check for any build errors or warnings in the pipeline logs.
Once the build succeeds, proceed with the deployment to the appropriate environment.
